# Space

Space is just visualization of real social media website. Any changes will not be saved, because app doesn't have backend side.

## If you want you can copy this app, for that use command:

```
git clone https://github.com/mkphercog/space
```

## In this project I'm using:

- react (CRA)
- typescript
- redux
- preprocessor SASS with methodology BEM

## See my project:
